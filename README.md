# OKP1Stationeers
OverKillPlusOne Stationeers Editor

Refreshed/rebuilt to work with Stationeers v0.2.2299.10449 -- The XML type for Machines had changed, but structure was/is the same.

This is a bare bones inventory editor for Stationeers.  Current functionality finished is the ability to edit reagents content (steel, iron, solder, etc) contained in machines.  Not all machine types are discovered as of right now.
