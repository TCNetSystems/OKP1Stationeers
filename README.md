OverKillPlusOne Stationeers Editor

*RELEASES PULLED*

I'm pulling the releases until I hear back from Microsoft as to why my Windows 7 machine with MS Security Essentials flagged the MSI as a trojan (but the Windows 10 variation of same did not) and testing with various other scanners is also showing nothing.

This is a bare bones inventory editor for Stationeers.  Current functionality finished is the ability to edit reagents content (steel, iron, solder, etc) contained in machines.  Not all machine types are discovered as of right now.
