*RELEASES FLAGGED AS TROJAN*

Looks like MSFT alreadt fixed their definitions.  If you attempt to install the 0.0.2 (or possibly 0.0.1) release and get a Trojan warning, update your security essentials/microsoft defender/whatever AV software!

I wanted to pull releases but apparently that's pretty much impossible in GitHub.  I've submitted to MSFT the false positive.  If you search for the ZIP or MSI's SHA-256 sum I've submitted them to VirusTotal's multiple scanning engine system, nothing found.  Hopefully Microsoft will fix their problem with Security Essentials.

You can see (or look up for yourself!) the [MSI](https://www.virustotal.com/ui-public/#/file/c3a3f96f6a031baefeaea24e61a8fb9a6c4392b4454e850b0b2c52c7ca226ddc/detection) and [ZIP](https://www.virustotal.com/ui-public/#/file/b57e3e1a167592f6dd717cceabfbceaac201a48e4bb1eedb0ad3e4a1d1b53006/detection) file results at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) yourself, or submit them to somewhere you trust yourself.

Basically in attempting to test install to my Windows 7 machine with MS Security Essentials the MSI was flagged as a trojan (but the Windows 10 variation of same did not) and testing with various other scanners is also showing nothing.

This is a bare bones inventory editor for Stationeers.  Current functionality finished is the ability to edit reagents content (steel, iron, solder, etc) contained in machines.  Not all machine types are discovered as of right now.
